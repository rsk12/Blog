                                <p>RDBMS Database is a relational database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. Data is stored in the form of rows and columns in RDBMS. The relations among tables are also stored in the form of the table SQL (Structured query Language) is a programming language used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or to retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, etc.</p></div>

                                <li><strong>Maintaining NoSQL Servers is Less Expensive:</strong>Maintaining high-end RDBMS systems is expensive and need trained manpower for database management but NoSQL databases require less management. it supports many Features like automatic repair, easier data distribution, and simpler data models make administration and tuning requirements lesser in NoSQL.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lesser Server Cost and Open-Source:</strong>NoSQL databases are cheap and open source. NoSQL database implementation is easy and typically uses cheap servers to manage the exploding data and transaction while RDBMS databases are expensive and it uses big servers and storage systems. So the storing and processing data cost per gigabyte in the case of NoSQL can be many times lesser than the cost of RDBMS.</li>
                                <li><strong>No Schema or Fixed Data model:</strong>NoSQL database is schema less so Data can be inserted in a NoSQL database without any predefined schema. So the format or data model can be changed any time, without application disruption. And change management is a big headache in SQL.</li>
                                <li><strong>Support Integrated Caching:</strong>NoSQL database support caching in system memory so it increases data output performance and SQL database where this has to be done using separate infrastructure.</li>

                            <p>MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is developed, distributed and supported by Oracle Corporation. Like other relational systems, MySQL stores data in tables and uses structured query language (SQL) for database access. In MySQL, you pre-define your database schema based on your requirements and set up rules to govern the relationships between fields in your tables. Any changes in schema necessitates a migration procedure that can take the database offline or significantly reduce application performance.

It also has connectors to languages like Node.js, Ruby, C#, C++, Java, Perl, Python and PHP, meaning that it’s not limited to SQL query language.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong>The database is open source and free.</li>
                                <li><strong>Replicable:</strong>The MySQL database can be replicated across multiple nodes, meaning that the workload can be reduced and the scalability and availability of the application can be increased.</li>

Related information is stored together for fast query access through the MongoDB query language. Fields can vary from document to document; there is no need to declare the structure of documents to the system – documents are self-describing. If a new field needs to be added to a document, then the field can be created without affecting all other documents in the collection, without updating a central system catalog, and without taking the system offline.

Although NoSQL databases have gained popularity for their speed and scalability, there are still situations in which a highly structured SQL database might be preferable"</b></u>. Two reasons why you might consider a SQL database are:

                                <li><strong>You need ACID compliancy (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  </strong>ACID compliancy reduces anomalies and protects the integrity of your database. It does this by defining exactly how transactions interact with the database, which is not the case with NoSQL databases, which have a primary goal of flexibility and speed, rather than 100% data integrity.</li>

                            <p>To prevent the database from becoming a system-wide bottleneck, especially in high volume environments, NoSQL databases perform in a way that relational databases cannot.
The following features are driving the popularity of NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Couch DB, Cassandra, and HBase:
.</p> Two reasons why you might consider a SQL database are:
                            </p>
                            
                              <ol>
                                <li><strong>Storing large volumes of data without structure </strong>A NoSQL database doesn’t limit storable data types. Plus, you can add new types as business needs change.</li>
                                <li><strong>Using cloud computing and storage.  </strong>Cloud-based storage is a great solution, but it requires data to be easily spread across multiple servers for scaling. Using affordable hardware on-site for testing and then for production in the cloud is what NoSQL databases are designed for.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Rapid development  </strong>If you are developing using modern agile methodologies, a relational database will slow you down. A NoSQL database doesn’t require the level of preparation typically needed for relational databases.</li>
            
                                </ol>

                            <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>To answer the main question: “when to use MongoDB instead of MySQL?” you need to take into account your project requirements and further goals.<u> MySQL is well-recognized for its high performance, flexibility, reliable data protection, high availability, and management ease. Proper data indexing can solve the issue with performance, facilitate interaction and ensure robustness. But if your “data is unstructured and complex, or if you can’t pre-define your schema, you’d better opt for MongoDB.”</u> And what is more, if you need to handle a large volume of data and store it as documents — MongoDB will help you to meet the challenges.</p>
